## 📄 TASK DESCRIPTION

The Real-Time Chat Application is Task 3 of my internship under CODTECH IT Solutions. The goal of this project was to build a real-time communication platform using React.js and Socket.IO that supports both group chat and private one-to-one messaging.

This application allows users to register with a username and immediately join a group chat. They can also select another user and initiate a private conversation. The app features real-time message delivery, typing indicators, and live user lists using WebSocket technology.

The project taught me how to implement bi-directional communication between client and server, manage unique socket connections, and design a clean and responsive user interface. It includes backend logic for managing user sessions and routing messages properly, and a frontend for displaying chat messages dynamically.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React.js** – For building the frontend interface 
- **Node.js & Express** – For creating the backend server
- **Socket.IO** – For real-time, bi-directional communication
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For logic and interactivity  
- **HTML5 & CSS3** – For structure and styling 
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and collaboration
